This script calculates the sum of days each email is being unread. Might be used to track how neglected your inbox is.

All the dependencies are included in Python standard library.

Note: the script has been tested only with Yandex.Mail

Given the email address 'login@yandex.ru' the login is 'login'.

```
$ python email_days.py

Login: login
Password: 
Unread messages: 5476
1918338.5147581955
```

So the `1918338.5147581955` is the number of email-days for your inbox.
